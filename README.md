# Social-Media-Spend-Analytics

## Overview
This project uses Tableau to create visualizations that analyze how Snapchat targets its users using ads. The visualizations are designed to help identify trends and make data-driven decisions.

## Questions to Answer
1. How does Snapchat target its user?
2. What would be the top 10 countries that Snapchat spends the most on for ads?
3. What are the top 5 cities that Snapchat implements ads on?
4. What organizations are targeting users in different countries?
5. What age range is targeted the most?
6. Different ratios of the age bracket for implementing ads.
7. When does Snapchat target its users?


## Installation
To view this project, you'll need to have Tableau installed on your machine. You can download Tableau from the official website.

Once you have Tableau installed, you can open the project file (.twb) and interact with the visualizations.

The donut chart below shows that among all the ad data, there’s 91.12% of ads use age of users as the target. These graphs are sorted, so it means that age is targeted the most, follows by segments, language, and interests.

As for this line chart below, I’d like to know when Snapchat targets its users. The result shows that the spend and the impressions are aligned with each other, and there’s a peak on November 6, which is the midterm election. This result indicates that Snapchat is a good place for the advertisers to invest in, aiming to impact the young generation’s thoughts about elections.

Lastly, the bar chart below shows who is paying Snapchat for ads, i.e., the top 5 paying advertiser names. The “Country” is an interactive filter, which can be used to choose which country for viewing in the dropdown list. And the “Spend” shows the minimum and the maximum spending among the advertisers in that country.
